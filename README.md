# 🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📍 Overview
This project focuses on predicting a country’s life expectancy based on various socio-economic, health, and environmental indicators using machine learning regression models. The analysis is based on a global dataset provided by WHO.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore and clean life expectancy data from multiple countries.
- Understand the relationship between life expectancy and features like GDP, schooling, healthcare, and immunization rates.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict life expectancy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Import the WHO dataset.
2. **EDA** – Visualize correlations and feature distributions.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
4. **Model Training** – Fit and evaluate regression models.
5. **Performance Metrics** – R² score, MAE, RMSE

## 📊 Sample Results
```bash
Best Model: Random Forest Regressor
R² Score: 0.93
MAE: 1.8
RMSE: 2.4
